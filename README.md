# Abstract

Familiarity with machine learning
has almost become a prerequisite for many of the most exciting employment opportunities, whether they are in bioinformatics, life science, or physics. 

In particular, applying classical methods of machine learning to the study of physical systems is the focus of an emergent area of physics research. For the purpose of improving the knowledge of this powerful tool, the use of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to a well known Model in Physics is developed in the present report. 

In this work we analyse the Ising Model from several approaches by means of Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression for 1D problem where there is no phase transition. For 2D Ising Model phase transition is considered. Neural Network methodology is applied to the same problem. Finally, a critical evaluation of the all the used algorithms is presented.
