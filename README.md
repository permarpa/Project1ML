# Use a branch
Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. 
Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a 
branch into another branch using a pull request.

Once you're satisfied with the changes in your branch, you can open a pull request to merge 
your branch (the head branch) into another branch (the base branch). For more information, see 
"About pull requests."

# About pull requests
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators
and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
